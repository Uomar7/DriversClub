            We provide a platform for junior,experienced and professional drivers to advertise themselves.
            All drivers are elligible to sign up and get their details displayed so that clients can contact them.
            Here you can be able to know between real drivers and fake drivers who pretend to be drivers
            so as to perform malicious acts.<br>
            So how do we ensure the drivers are real?<br>
            We ensure that every driver registering must give the information on their ID and Drivers license.
            This way you can be able to check registration numbers on <a
              href="https://www.nextinsurance.co.ke/blog/check-driving-licence-original-kenya/"> NTSA</a> to confirm
            their authenticity yourself.

              <p id="par-about">You can check out if your license is original. Remember,with the new innovated digital
                license,
                you will have to keep renewing your license after every set time. This new system as implemented
                by the CS of transport Fred Matiangi,is quite complex. Well the new system is actually considered of
                great advantages
                even though it comes with the burden of frequent assesment tests of drivers to verify their
                ability to keep themselves and others safe on the road.</p>

            <P>In many jurisdictions, bus drivers must have a special license above and beyond a regular driver's licence.
               Bus drivers typically drive their vehicles between bus stations or stops. Bus drivers often drop off and pick up passengers on a predetermined route schedule.
                In British English a different term, coach driver (or coach captain), is used for drivers on privately booked long-distance routes, tours and school trips.

                    There are various types of bus drivers, including transit drivers,
                         school bus drivers and tour bus drivers. Bus drivers may work for a city,
                     public (state and national/federal) governments, school boards, and private enterprises, such as charter companies which run tour buses
                      . Coach captains in Australia are frequently freelance sub-contractors who work for various bus and coach companies. Bus drivers also need
                     to possess social skills for interacting with their passengers,
                        which is a daily occurrence.
