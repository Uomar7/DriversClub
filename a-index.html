            <div class="club">
             <p>Drivers club is a platform for drivers themselves.<br>
                As a driver you can sign up and get to advertise yourself either<br>
                as a taxi driver,bus driver or driver for hire.<br>
                The idea came out of the problem that some people got to<br>
                driving schools but sit at home with their licenses.<br>
                At Drivers club,we give the drivers the oppurtunity to make<br>
                their profile and be able to be viewed by potential clients.<br>
                Where be a sacco or a normal client,can view drivers profile<br>
                and and select the driver of their choice then contact them.</p>
